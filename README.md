# android-transcribe
A library for Android that converts any audio or speech to text as transcriptions with word-level timestamps (Uses whisper, OpenAI AI etc, multiple models internally)


We already have a fully functional MVP for the library; we are preparing it for public use on a device.

Please drop a star, or email me at manindersingh030@gmail.com to get early access
